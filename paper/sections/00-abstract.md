## Abstract

Making reproducible work is important for many reasons. Reproducibility has an enormous effect on the impact of a study because if results cannot be verified, they cannot be trusted and utilized in a meaningful way. One of the steps to making sure results are accurate, and a large part of using those results to increase findings in the same field, is to make sure another researcher is able to replicate your experiment and come to the same conclusions. Therefore, we must strive to create a platform in which research can be reproduced. There is much debate about the structure, qualifications, and downfalls of certain methods of reproducibility, but there are tools we can use to make reproducing an experiment easier. To make this paper, I used some of these tools that easily and quickly regenerate my work. This will allow anyone to follow the instructions provided and reach the same end result. The hope is to familiarize people with these tools enough to ensure research can be easily shared and built upon in the future. The goal of this paper is to describe the tools use to build it and provide a tutorial on how to build it again.
