## Conclusions

There are many different ways of making research reproducible. The paper that I made is just one example of a way to make reports easy to share and replicate. Github, git, Makefiles, Markdown and pandoc are tools that can be used to format, convert, produce, and share content. Reproducibility also includes running entirely different experiments and coming to the same conclusions or running the same experiment with different data and finding the same results. These tools I have outlined may not lend themselves to these routes of reproducibility as well but they can be helpful in documenting and sharing research which is a key part of reproducibility as a whole.
