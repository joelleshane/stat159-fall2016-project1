## Introduction

First I?d like to provide an overview of the process I will discuss in detail later. The purpose of this project was to create a reproducible paper; a paper that can be duplicated by anyone with basic computer knowledge with ease. First the paper?s content is created, in the way that any paper, experiment, or study would be, with possibly different folders for the data, images, or analysis. In this paper, the different sections are more for exercise than anything else, but in a big research project they can help keep the data organized and keep the results clean and easily interpreted without the clutter of code, raw data, intermediate steps etc. After the content is created, these separate chunks are stitched together to create a coherent report. This is done in a way that allows for a quick change of the final product if someone wants to go back and edit something. This is extremely important because it can be tedious to edit an entire project because of maybe a small mistake or miscalculation, something we expect to arise in the process of research and discovery, especially when people are reviewing your work. The tools used in the paper allows for the change of one part of the paper and a simple way to implement those changes into the final product without much effort. Finally, the paper is uploaded onto a site that takes it from just my computer and publishes it online so it can be replicated, viewed, and shared by others.
