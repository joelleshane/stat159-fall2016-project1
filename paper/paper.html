<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Making reproducible work is important for many reasons. Reproducibility has an enormous effect on the impact of a study because if results cannot be verified, they cannot be trusted and utilized in a meaningful way. One of the steps to making sure results are accurate, and a large part of using those results to increase findings in the same field, is to make sure another researcher is able to replicate your experiment and come to the same conclusions. Therefore, we must strive to create a platform in which research can be reproduced. There is much debate about the structure, qualifications, and downfalls of certain methods of reproducibility, but there are tools we can use to make reproducing an experiment easier. To make this paper, I used some of these tools that easily and quickly regenerate my work. This will allow anyone to follow the instructions provided and reach the same end result. The hope is to familiarize people with these tools enough to ensure research can be easily shared and built upon in the future. The goal of this paper is to describe the tools use to build it and provide a tutorial on how to build it again.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>First I?d like to provide an overview of the process I will discuss in detail later. The purpose of this project was to create a reproducible paper; a paper that can be duplicated by anyone with basic computer knowledge with ease. First the paper?s content is created, in the way that any paper, experiment, or study would be, with possibly different folders for the data, images, or analysis. In this paper, the different sections are more for exercise than anything else, but in a big research project they can help keep the data organized and keep the results clean and easily interpreted without the clutter of code, raw data, intermediate steps etc. After the content is created, these separate chunks are stitched together to create a coherent report. This is done in a way that allows for a quick change of the final product if someone wants to go back and edit something. This is extremely important because it can be tedious to edit an entire project because of maybe a small mistake or miscalculation, something we expect to arise in the process of research and discovery, especially when people are reviewing your work. The tools used in the paper allows for the change of one part of the paper and a simple way to implement those changes into the final product without much effort. Finally, the paper is uploaded onto a site that takes it from just my computer and publishes it online so it can be replicated, viewed, and shared by others.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>There were several key components of creating the paper. The first step was to set up the directories in which all the content for the paper would be located. In Terminal, I created a directory called <em>&quot;stat159-project1&quot;</em> and cd?d into it. Then I created the subdirectories <em>&quot;paper&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;images&quot;</em> for all the content to be neatly organized into these folders. This part is easy and only requires simple commands in terminal (<strong>mkdir</strong> and <strong>cd</strong>). Then I needed to actually write the content that would be going into the paper. These were stored on four separate <em>.md</em> files and were written using Markdown.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/markdown-logo.png" alt="Markdown" />
<p class="caption">Markdown</p>
</div>
<p>Markdown is a markup language that provides a way to simply format papers and reports. It?s simplicity and user friendliness makes it easy to write content in markdown and transform it into other formatting. Markdown is used to style any computer generated content.</p>
<p>The <em>?images?</em> folder was then populated from downloads from another github repository that had <em>.png</em> files in it. The paper is composed of four parts:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Part of Paper</th>
<th>File Name in Computer</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Abstract</td>
<td>00-abstract.md</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Introduction</td>
<td>01-introduction.md</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Discussion</td>
<td>02-discussion.md</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Conclusions</td>
<td>03-conclusions.md</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of these parts were created in Markdown as individual files and stored in the subdirectory <em>?paper.?</em> Some of the individual files called on files in the <em>?images?</em> folder to include images in the report. This is done using this syntax (without dashes):</p>
<p>!-[Image Name]-(image/path.png) and produced results like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/stat159-logo.png" alt="Image" />
<p class="caption">Image</p>
</div>
<p>The next step is to compile these files together to create one cohesive paper. This is done by using a Makefile, a file that is included in the parent directory and includes instructions on what to do to different files to create the desired output. For this project, I wanted to combine the four sections of the paper and create a <em>.md</em> file and a <em>.html</em> file. The first step in a Makefile is to enter a target (what you want the makefile to create) and it?s dependencies (what it will use to make the desired output), separating these with a colon. Then, on the next line, you enter a tab and then the commands you want the Makefile to preform. For this project, I wanted to create a document called <em>?paper.md?</em> by concatenating the four files that included the components of the paper and then also create a file called <em>?paper.html?</em> that would be an html version of the same paper.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/pandoc-logo.png" alt="pandoc" />
<p class="caption">pandoc</p>
</div>
<p>This is done by using pandoc, a document converter that changes files from one file format to another. The advantages of pandoc is the ability to write a report in one format that may be consistent with the coding language you are using or the applications you want to run to produce the report, and then you are able to convert it to another format so it?s easier to share and can be used by people with different coding languages, file systems, etc. This allows many different users with completely different programs to access the same information and research, increasing the paper?s reproducibility.</p>
<p>The reason we use a Makefile for this process is so in the future, if I were to edit any one of the four sections of the paper, I could re-run the make file and it would re-create my paper including the changes. This is especially helpful if you want to keep your data separate from your analysis, for example, and then want to add more data to your report later. The Makefile saves a lot of time by automatically updating the files. I added a command ?<strong>all</strong>? which tells the computer to run all of the targets listed afterward in the Makefile, just to make sure Makefile does not only run the first component thinking the second component should only be run if it?s needed to complete the first part. The Makefile is extremely helpful in reproducibility because anyone who has access to the Makefile should have no problems replicating my paper simply by running the Makefile themselves.</p>

</div>
<p>Now that the paper was created and could be created time and time again on my computer, it was time to create a platform with which I could share my paper and make it easily reproducible by anyone. For this I used Github, which is an online repository that allows users to upload and re-upload content from their computer. This allows researches, students, and professors alike to manipulate data, projects, reports, etc. on their computer and quickly share it online. This way not everything has to be updated online immediately, but you can upload your progress or edits when you are ready. In this project, I had all my content and files stored on my computer, but to be able to share it I needed to create a github repository called ?<em>stat159-fall2016-project1</em>.? This is where I uploaded the paper and all the files I had created in order for others to be able to view and reproduce my work. To push the files from my computer to the github repository, I had to use another tool called Git.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/git-logo.png" alt="Git" />
<p class="caption">Git</p>
</div>
<p>Git is a version control system that stores information from terminal as you go and allows the user to save their progress incrementally. The first command ran is ?<strong>git init</strong>? which will initialize a git subdirectory where all your files will be stored. Git allows you to modify your file and then add it to the staging area, files here will later be committed to your database when you run the commit command. After that, all you have to do is run ?<strong>git remote add origin (link to your online github repository)</strong>? which will create the path to which the remote repository will upload to. Running ?<strong>git push origin master</strong>? will upload all of your content online in the github repository you specified. Later, if you want to modify any content in the paper and then re-upload it to github, you need to run ?<strong>git pull (link to your online github repository)</strong>? to sync the online repository with yours and make it available to upload your new content.</p>
<p>All someone would have to do to reproduce my paper would be to pull the content from my <em>&quot;stat159-fall2016-project1&quot;</em> repository and run the Makefile. Then they should generate my exact paper and be able to edit it and upload it to a different github repository if they wanted to.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>There are many different ways of making research reproducible. The paper that I made is just one example of a way to make reports easy to share and replicate. Github, git, Makefiles, Markdown and pandoc are tools that can be used to format, convert, produce, and share content. Reproducibility also includes running entirely different experiments and coming to the same conclusions or running the same experiment with different data and finding the same results. These tools I have outlined may not lend themselves to these routes of reproducibility as well but they can be helpful in documenting and sharing research which is a key part of reproducibility as a whole.</p>
