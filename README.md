In order to reproduce the paper, you'll first need to grab all the contents from my github repository *"stat159-fall2016-project1."* In order to do this, run the command **git clone (URl on my github repositiory under the tab "Clone or Download")** to copy the repository and the files it contains to your computer. From there, you'll be able to run the Makefile using the command **make** in terminal and the Makefile will create the *paper.md* file and the *paper.html* file.
